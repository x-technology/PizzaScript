# 2021-05-08 - WebAssembly Overview - Compilation Target for PizzaScript

## About

Hello PizzaScript üçï lovers! ‚ù§Ô∏è
PizzaScript or *.ps;) is a new cool programming language with no-ordinary paradigm üòÄ 

In these materials, we overview key concepts of creating a new programming language. We show the simple implementation of a toy language PizzaScript üçïusing Golang and RxGo. This series can help beginners in learning Golang and WebAssembly, and experiment with a live open source project. 

Our goals are:
- Learn Go language, including key libraries like RxGo
- Understand how programming languages & interpreters work
- Experiment with WebAssembly

PizzaScript Meetup #3 focuses on a compilation target for programming languages. For PizzaScript we have chosen WebAssembly, because it is an awesome techology supported in main modern browsers and multiple environments. First, we need to understand what is WebAssembly, and we will overview history, key features and benefits of the technology. We'll explore interesting examples and problems we might be facing while implementing the PizzaScript's compilation phase.
